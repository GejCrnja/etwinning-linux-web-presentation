		<h1 class="text-light">Welcome! </h1>
		<p class="lead text-light">
Linux commands may seem intimidating at first glance if you are not used to using the terminal. There are many commands for performing operations and processes on your Linux system.
</p>
		<h2 class="text-light">Some useful commands</h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">The CD command, also known as chdir (change directory), is a command-line shell command used to change the current working directory in various operating systems. It can be used in shell scripts and batch files. </p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">The ls command also accepts some flags (also known as options) which are additional information that changes how files or directories are listed in your terminal.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">The cat (short for “concatenate“) command is one of the most frequently used command in Linux/Unix like operating systems. cat command allows us to create single or multiple files, view contain of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files. </p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">cp stands for copy. This command is used to copy files or group of files or directory. It creates an exact image of a file on a disk with different file name. cp command require at least two filenames in its arguments.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">rm removes each file specified on the command line. By default, it does not remove directories. When rm is executed with the -r or -R options, it recursively deletes any matching directories, their subdirectories, and all files they contain. See removing directories below for details.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">The git pull command is used to get updates from the remote repo. This command is a combination of git fetch and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, it gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">Grep is an acronym that stands for Global Regular Expression Print.
Grep is a Linux / Unix command-line tool used to search for a string of characters in a specified file. The text search pattern is called a regular expression. When it finds a match, it prints the line with the result. The grep command is handy when searching through large log files.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-light">Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing. It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with the specified patterns and then performs the associated actions. Awk is abbreviated from the names of the developers – Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.</p>
