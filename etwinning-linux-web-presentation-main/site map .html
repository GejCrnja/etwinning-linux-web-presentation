            <p class="text-light">Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system              resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.
                Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment. They are packaged separately and you can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal working environment.
                Another priority of Xfce is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at freedesktop.org.

            <h2 class="text-light">BunsenLabs </h2>
            <p class="text-light">Briefly: A distro that's carrying the Crunchbang torch onwards
                Crunchbang (or #!) was a very popular Debian-derived distro specifically designed to use as few system resources as possible. While it was discontinued in 2013, the community fondly remembered its lightning speed and responded with two Crunchbang-based distros to continue its legacy.
                However, one of those successors, Crunchbang++, has now been discontinued. BunsenLabs is still active, though, and its current release (Lithium) is based on the latest stable version of Debian featuring a gorgeously configured Openbox window manager and its own repository of core packages.
                The distro ships with an assortment of themes and wallpapers, and includes a number of everyday desktop apps to provide a very usable out-of-the-box experience. 
                BunsenLabs is available for both 32-bit and 64-bit machines, and the developers recommend running the distro on a machine with more than 2 GB of RAM.

                Puppy Linux uses JWM and Openbox window managers by default which makes it very easy on system resources.
                Because Puppy Linux is built to be fast, it does not come along with bundles of applications. It does have some basic apps, though. In other words, it can get your work done if you want to utilize a really old computer.

                Tiny Core simply incorporates the fundamental core of an OS which includes the kernel and the root filesystem. In other words, it features the foundation of a desktop OS.
                If you simply want a system to boot up coupled with a wired Internet connection, you can get started using it. But, you should not expect proper hardware support out of the box.
                So, if you’re someone who knows how to set up or compile tools necessary with Tiny Core Linux to make it a complete desktop experience, you can give it a try.

                Porteus is a small (under 300MB) portable linux distribution based on Slackware linux and a heavily modified version of the linux-live scripts. It is modular in design, meaning programs (or collections of programs) can be installed and removed simply by double clicking on module files.  Unlike other Linux distributions that have a 'live CD' option, or can be shoehorned onto a flash drive, Porteus is designed and optimized to run from a USB flash drive, flash card or CD. It can also be installed in it's compressed form to an external or internal hard disk (AKA a 'frugal' install). With it's small footprint, modest system requirements, wifi support and modern kernel, Porteus is also ideally suited to run on netbooks.

                SliTaz uses the Openbox window manager.
                Additional packages are added using a program called "TazPanel". This is due to the specific package format that SliTaz uses (tazpkg). It can still use packages from the more popular distribution though, as Debian, by means of first carrying out a conversion of these different packages
                By default, SliTaz offers no persistence, however it can still be added if the user wishes. The choice of the filesystem/bootloader used with slitaz is then of importance however; persistence being only available with ext2 and ext3 filesystems and the syslinux or extlinux boot loader.
                Another useful tool is TazLiTo, with which users can create their own LiveCD based on selected packages or even based upon the current system state.

            <h2 class="text-light">LXDE</h2>
            <p class="text-light">The "Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment" is an extremely fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment. Maintained by an international community of developers, it comes with a beautiful interface, multi-language support, standard keyboard short cuts and additional features like tabbed file browsing. LXDE uses less CPU and less RAM than other environments. It is especially designed for cloud computers with low hardware specifications, such as, netbooks, mobile devices (e.g. MIDs) or older computers. LXDE can be installed with distributions like Ubuntu or Debian. It provides a fast desktop experience; connecting easily with applications in the cloud. LXDE supports a wealth of programs that can be installed locally with Linux systems. The source code of LXDE is licensed partly under the terms of the the General Public License and partly under the LGPL.

            <h2 class="text-light">Lubuntu</h2>
            <p class="text-light">Lubuntu is a fast and lightweight operating system with a clean and easy-to-use user interface. It is a Linux system, that uses the minimal desktop LXDE/LXQT, and a selection of light applications. Because of this, Lubuntu has very low hardware requirements. Lubuntu was founded by Mario Behling and has been grown for many years by Julien Lavergne.

                Lubuntu originally used the LXDE desktop, but moved to the LXQt desktop with the release of Lubuntu 18.10 in October 2018, due to the slow development of LXDE, losing support for GTK 2 as well as the more active and stable LXQt development without Gnome dependencies.
                
                The LXDE desktop was first made available for Ubuntu in October 2008, with the release of Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex. These early versions of Lubuntu, including 8.10, 9.04 and 9.10, were not available as separate ISO image downloads, and could only be installed on Ubuntu as separate lubuntu-desktop packages from the Ubuntu repositories. LXDE can also be retroactively installed in earlier Ubuntu versions.
